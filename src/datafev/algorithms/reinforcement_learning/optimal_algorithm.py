# TODO - Create an algorithm which interacts with the same simulation environment and picks
#  where to go at any given time interval based on the following:
#  - If you can get to destination on current battery, go to destination
#  - If you can't get to destination on current battery, go to closest charging station
#  - If at charging station, charge until fully charged
#  The intent is to use this as a comparison to the RL model's choices
