# TODO - Create an algorithm which interacts with the same simulation environment and picks
#  where to go at any given time interval based on the following:
#  - Minimize the total time spent charging
#  - Minimize the total time spent driving
#  The intent is to use this as a comparison to the RL model's choices
#  This is based on Tesla's "Trip Planner"
