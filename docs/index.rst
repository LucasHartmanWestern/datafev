Documentation
==================
Python package datafev is a framework for the development, testing, and assessment of managemant algorithms for EV charging scenarios. The framework allows to develop scenario-oriented management strategies. It includes a portfolio of optimization- and rule-based algorithms to coordinate charging and routing operations in clustered charging systems. Furthermore, it provides statistical scenario generation tool to create EV fleet demand profiles. Its target users are researchers in the field of smart grid applications and the deployment of operational flexibility for local energy systems.
